We have online trading systems that provide real-time data and we want to make
it available for historical analysis. The data that we want to process and store consists
of metadata (timestamp of event, source system ID) and payload (stock ID, bid price, ask
price). This data can be retrieved from the source systems in two different ways:

 - A subscription API (i.e. gRPC)
 - An event log file in CSV format (written every minute on a disk, retained for 1 day)

Note, trading systems are network latency critical and are active while an exchange
is open i.e 09:00-18:00.

Design a system that will collect events from such trading systems, process and store it for historical
analysis. We expect a system level design describing the major components and reasons for using them.
Limit the detail to a single page.
